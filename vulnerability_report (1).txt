# Firewall Configuration Report
Author: Neel Bhatt
Date: June 27, 2025

## Configuration Details
- Tool: UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) on Kali Linux
- Actions: 
  - Installed UFW after resolving repository issues
  - Blocked inbound traffic on port 23 (Telnet)
  - Allowed inbound traffic on port 22 (SSH)
  - Restored original state by removing the test rule

## Testing Results
- Blocked Port 23: Successfully tested with `nc` (netcat), resulting in "connection refused"
- Allowed Port 22: SSH rule added; test skipped if no SSH server is configured

## How Firewall Filters Traffic
- UFW filters network traffic by applying rules to incoming and outgoing packets based on port numbers, protocols, and IP addresses.
- It operates with a default deny policy, blocking all unauthorized access unless explicitly permitted (e.g., port 22).
- Rules are evaluated in sequence, ensuring blocked ports (e.g., 23) are enforced unless overridden by allow rules.

## Notes
- Resolved repository key error using modern key management.
- Used `nc` for testing the block rule, with results verified via screenshot.
